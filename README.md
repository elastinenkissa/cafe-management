# Autoheadache

Autoheadache is a WIP mobile application created using React Native for the frontend and Node, Express and MongoDB for the backend, all using TypeScript.

# Usage

The application was originally made for personal use at my sunday job as a waiter-barista at a family cafe. I am currently restructuring it to have a server and be able to be configured by other cafe owners for their employees to use.

# Todo

1. Create REST API
2. Make and implement login and create cafe functionalities
3. Upload the app for sale on Google Play (after finding a way to pay $25 developer fee)
