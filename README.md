# Autoheadache

Autoheadache is a WIP mobile application created using React Native for the frontend and Node, Express and MongoDB for the backend, all using TypeScript.

# Usage

The application was originally made for personal use at my sunday job as a waiter-barista at a family cafe. I am currently restructuring it to have a server and be able to be configured by other cafe owners for their employees to use.

# Todo


1. Finish the app up (api requests, polish UI, add funcitonality for owner to edit names of employees, names and prices of menu items, etc.)
2. Upload the app for sale on Google Play (after finding a way to pay $25 developer fee)
3. (Optional) Replace the states in NewMenuItem with a reducer
