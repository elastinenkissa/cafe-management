# Autoheadache

Autoheadache is a WIP mobile application created using React Native for the frontend and Node, Express and MongoDB for the backend, all using TypeScript.

# Usage

The application was originally made for personal use at my sunday job as a waiter-barista at a family cafe. I am currently restructuring it to have a server and be able to be configured by other cafe owners for their employees to use.

# Todo

1. Make marking deptor as paid possible on each deptor's page
2. Add possibility to transfer order from table to deptor from each table's page
3. Create a server and transform the app into a customizable cafe app (add user system, owner-only dashboard - add or remove tables, add or remove menu items and their prices, create accounts for employees, have logs of what each employee has done and at what time, etc.)
