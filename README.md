# Autoheadache

Autoheadache is a WIP mobile application created using React Native for the frontend and Node, Express and MongoDB for the backend, all using TypeScript.

# Usage

The application was originally made for personal use at my sunday job as a waiter-barista at a family cafe. I am currently restructuring it to have a server and be able to be configured by other cafe owners for their employees to use.

# Todo

1. Come up with what marking a table or deptor as paid will do
2. Replace context with redux due to need of high frequency changes in global state
3. Add dashboard for cafe owner
4. Add login system
5. Create a server
