# Autoheadache

Autoheadache is a WIP mobile application created using React Native for the frontend and Node, Express and MongoDB for the backend, all using TypeScript.

# Usage

The application was originally made for personal use at my sunday job as a waiter-barista at a family cafe. I am currently restructuring it to have a server and be able to be configured by other cafe owners for their employees to use.

# Todo


1. Finish the app up (api requests, polish UI - row items same distance at all times, etc.)
2. Upload the app for sale on Google Play (after finding a way to pay $25 developer fee)
3. (Optional) Replace the states in NewMenuItem with a reducer
